======================
**Configuration file**
======================
This section covers the skysearcher rc file's function and contents.  Skysearcher should handle the file system setup and check without issue.  Once skysearcher can not see a config file in it's top level (*root*) directory, it will build and place a new one.  The ``PATH`` variables should be okay but double check just to be safe.  Skysearcher writes a lot of small data files as part of the parallel process.
