python skysearcher/skysearcher.py

This is the main program and the only script intended to be run.
All settings are in the rc.cfg file.  If there is not an rc.cfg
file, then run this program and one will be written.

All values that are set by the configuration file are marked
like this: <<ss_lib.variable_value>>.  All values are defined
in the ss_lib so this script stays clean and readable.
