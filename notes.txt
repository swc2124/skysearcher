If you’re looking for things to do between now and 29th

	1) Add these to the document where you’re describing your work.
		- make some summary statements of trends you see for general properties of features found in ranges (say) 0-50, 50-100, 100-200 kpc
		- then say benefits and flaws of what you can learn from features

	2) Also add some plots and description of your feature finder earlier in the document
	
	3) Then go on to start asking the question - can we relate the properties of the features to the satellites from which they came (e.g. mass and accretion time)?General 
			- e.g. scale or nstars vs mass???? - might have to be in small radius range
			- (something you’ve been talking about for a while): color vs mass and/or age (maybe color of brightest stars???)
